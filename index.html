    <h3 class="text-center my-8 text-2xl font-bold">About Us</h3>
    <p class="text-center my-4">We wanted to create a platform where anyone can build an awesome personal brand, regardless of their previous experience.</p>
    <p class="text-center my-4">We were two ex-colleagues who found ourselves in the same position: one looking to share his knowledge and one looking to build his notoriety so he could get more leads. But we had the same problem: we felt like we didn’t have the skills to create a great brand for ourselves, and it made us feel overwhelmed and stuck.</p>
    <p class="text-center my-4">So, we created Brandist so you don’t have that feeling! By mixing best practices with technology, we believe that anyone has the power to create their own reputation and voice in the world.</p>
